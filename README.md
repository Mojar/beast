BEAST
=====
Based off a game I enjoyed when I first started playing computer games: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_(video_game)

Jan. 03, 2013
Initially created in 2 days after finishing my first programming course at McGill.

Todo: 
- Make a user interface to change the Gameboard settings (Options menu before play)
- Experiment with higher-end graphics, similar style of Geometry Wars
- Add multiplayer (networked play?)
- Allow player to be enemy?
